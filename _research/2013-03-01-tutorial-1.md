* Deep Neural Network

Adopted encoder-decoder model to preserve spatial information of pooled deep features. Based on the initialization of optical flow net to transfer learning segmentation boundaries.

* Unsupervised Learning

Leveraged well designed loss function to train Neural Networks with unsupervised learning. Based on recent papers, improved the architecture to train a more general model to well fit optical flow and reduce overfitting.
