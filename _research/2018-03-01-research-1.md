* Supervisor: "Prof. Learned-Miller"

* Primary Goal

The inspiration is the effect of camera rotation on the photograph is invariant to the depth of scene while the effect of camera translation is proportional to the inverse of depth. The purpose of the project is to get the estimations of camera motion, relative depth map of the scene and stitching video frames to form a panorama.

* Image Registration with Auto-tracker

Key points such as corners and edges are extracted by the state-of-art auto-tracker and least square method is used to compute appropriate rotation parameters.

* Pixel Congealing

Congealing is a way of aligning a set of images simultaneously, using an entropy minimization procedure. I implemented the algorithm in python based on negative log-likelihoods minimization and gradient descent to tweak optimal camera rotations, translations and depths parameters.
