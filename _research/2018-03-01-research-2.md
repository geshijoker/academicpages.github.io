* Supervisor: "Prof. Learned-Miller"

* Deep Neural Network

Adopted encoder-decoder model to preserve spatial information of pooled deep features. Based on the initialization of optical flow net to transfer learning segmentation boundaries.

* Unsupervised Learning

Leveraged well designed loss function penalizing both image gradients and motion smoothness to train Neural Networks with unsupervised learning. Based on UnFlow, Fine-tuned the pre-trained optical flow model on the DAVIS Dataset.
