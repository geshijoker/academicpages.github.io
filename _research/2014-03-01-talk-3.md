* Optical Flow

Applied optical flow theory to establish a fully direct probabilistic model minimizing photometric error. Generated dense 3D points cloud by utilizing lie group algebra in computer vision to estimate the pose of camera and position of features

* Robot Operating System

Based on ROS (Robot Operating System), Linux and toolbox/library (OpenSLAM & OpenCV) to develop an offline SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) system.

* Improvement of DSO

Used DUO MLX stereo camera to fit in the Direct Sparse Odometry algorithm; Improved the performance of DSO in weak light environment using binocular camera, infrared filter and IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit)
