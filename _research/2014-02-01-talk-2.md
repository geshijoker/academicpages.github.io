* Convolutional Neural Network

Applied Deep FCNs method in semantic image segmentation tasks. Adopting proposed pyramid scene parsing network (PSPNet) to learn features and working on PASCAL VOC 2012 and Cityscapes datasets.

* Conditional Random Field

Utilized CRF (conditional random field) algorithm to refine the boundary of segmentation. Adapted the classical algorithm with heuristic pairwise potential to avoid miss classification. The loss function is trained on SVM.
