* Supervisor: "Prof. Yu Zhang"

* Optical Flow

Applied optical flow theory to establish a fully direct probabilistic model minimizing photometric error. Generated dense 3D points cloud by utilizing lie group algebra in computer vision to estimate the pose of camera and position of features

* Robot Operating System

Using ROS (Robot Operating System), Linux and toolbox/library (OpenSLAM & OpenCV), developed an offline SLAM (simultaneous localization and mapping) system.

* Improvement of DSO

Used stereo camera and infrared filter to fit in the Direct Sparse Odometry algorithm; Improved the performance of DSO of long term tasks with Kalman filter and IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit).
