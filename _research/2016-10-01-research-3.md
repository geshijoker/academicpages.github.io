* Convolutional Neural Network

Applied Deep FCNs methods in semantic image segmentation tasks. Adopting proposed pyramid scene parsing network (PSPNet) to learn features and working on PASCAL VOC 2012 and Cityscapes datasets.

* Conditional Random Field

Utilized CRF (conditional random field) algorithm to refine the segmentation of boundary. Adapted the classical algorithm with heuristic pairwise potential to avoid miss classification. The loss function is trained on structured SVM layer.
