* Image Registration with Auto-tracker

The inspiration of the project is the sensibility of pixels in a video frames formed by a fixed focal length camera is mono-scaled with respect to camera rotation while it is proportional to camera translation. The purpose of the project is to register the background of the images leaving out of the foreground. First, key points such as corners and edges are extracted by the state-of-art auto-tracker and least square method is used to compute appropriate rotation parameters.

* Pixel Congealing

Congealing is a way of aligning a group of objects simultaneously , using an entropy minimization procedure. I implemented the algorithm in python and matlab based on passive motion recovering theory and negative log-likelihoods minimization to tweak optimal camera rotations, translations and depths parameters.
